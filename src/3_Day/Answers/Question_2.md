## 2. Write a C program to print all natural numbers in reverse (from n to 1). â€“ using while loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;
    
    printf("Enter the value of n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    i = n;
    while (i >= 1) {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i--;
    }
    
    return 0;
}

```
### Explanation :
- The program starts by including the necessary header files, defining the main function, and declaring the necessary variables.
- It prompts the user to enter the value of n using the `printf` and `scanf` functions to receive input.
- It initializes a variable i to n, which represents the current natural number being printed.
- It uses a while loop to print each natural number in reverse order, from n down to 1.
    - The condition i >= 1 is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
    - As long as this condition is true, the loop body will execute. Within the loop, the current value of i is printed using the printf function, followed by a space.
    - Then i is decremented by 1 using the i-- statement, so that the next natural number in reverse order will be printed on the next iteration of the loop.
- When the loop has finished executing (i.e. i has reached 0), the program returns 0, indicating successful completion.
- Overall, this program uses a simple while loop to print all natural numbers in reverse order from n to 1, making it easy to understand and modify for similar tasks.
